    "- designed to avoid traditional locking mechanisms (like sync.Mutex) by leveraging atomic operations. \n",
    "- These atomic operations ensure that certain actions (like updating a variable or pointer) happen indivisibly, meaning no other goroutine can interrupt the operation mid-way. \n",
    "- As a result, lock-free structures ensure that multiple goroutines can work on shared data simultaneously, without one goroutine blocking another."

    "# Common Lock-Free Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Atomic Variables\n",
    "- simplest form of lock-free data structure. \n",
    "- used for operations that involve basic data types, eg: integers / pointers. \n",
    "- Go’s sync/atomic package provides atomic operations like Add, Load, Store, CompareAndSwap for manipulating these variables safely in concurrent environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Cases:**\n",
    "\n",
    "• Simple counters that need to be incremented/decremented by multiple goroutines.\n",
    "• Flags or state variables that multiple goroutines may need to update or check.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Lock-Free Queue (Michael-Scott Queue)\n",
    "- a classic example of a lock-free, FIFO (First In, First Out) queue. It allows multiple producers and consumers to enqueue and dequeue items concurrently without blocking each other. The key to the Michael-Scott Queue’s efficiency is its use of CAS operations to update the head and tail of the queue atomically.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Cases:**\n",
    "\n",
    "• Task scheduling where many goroutines add and remove tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Message passing between multiple producers and consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Lock-Free Stack (Treiber Stack)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Treiber Stack is a lock-free, Last In, First Out (LIFO) stack. Like the Michael-Scott Queue, it uses CAS to manage concurrent access. However, instead of a queue’s head and tail, the Treiber Stack maintains a top pointer, which is updated by pushing and popping elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Cases:**\n",
    "\n",
    "• Object pools, where objects are frequently pushed and popped.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Undo/Redo stacks in concurrent environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Lock-Free Ring Buffer\n",
    "\n",
    "A Ring Buffer (or circular buffer) is a fixed-size data structure where data overwrites itself when full. A lock-free version of the ring buffer can be implemented by using atomic operations to manage the head and tail indices. It is particularly useful in producer-consumer scenarios where you need a bounded queue that can handle high-throughput data streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Cases:**\n",
    "\n",
    "• Bounded queues for data streams, such as log processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Producer-consumer scenarios where memory needs to be tightly controlled.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Lock-Free Linked List\n",
    "\n",
    "Lock-free linked lists can be tricky to implement, but they provide an ordered structure that allows multiple goroutines to insert, delete, or traverse nodes concurrently. These lists usually use atomic operations to manipulate pointers to nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Cases:**\n",
    "\n",
    "• Managing ordered collections of elements in highly concurrent systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Scenarios where traversing and modifying a shared list is necessary."
